The idea here is to create a web page that utilizes JSONP to send sensitive data to the client.

Requirements:
- A bot client is authenticated to the sensitive domain
- The bot client connects to the attacker-controlled page
- The attacker can visit the sensitive page and authenticate to see his/her own version of the page.
- The flag is some data within the JSONP javascript for the bot.
